## 🧠 Abstract

Planck energy (Eₚ) is typically regarded as a dimensional limit at the intersection of gravity and quantum theory, but its physical origin remains undefined in standard frameworks. This work derives Eₚ from first principles within the **Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)** model—a Lorentz-invariant field theory in which physical action emerges from quantized coherence cycles in a conserved substrate.

We show that Eₚ corresponds to the **maximum coherent energy supportable by a single substrate envelope**, defined by transverse propagation speed (cₜ), scalar pacing (cₛ), gravitational compliance (G), and coherence length (L_coh):

**Eₚ = (cₜ⁴ / G) · L_coh**

Collapse is reframed as a causal, structural failure in the substrate—not a singularity—yielding testable predictions for quantized emission, rupture dynamics, and the mass spectrum of stable structures.
